ZSLP Dividend Calculator
========================

A simple JS dividend calculator for ZCL/ZSLP.

Code isn't clean and the site isn't responsive but that kind of things can be improved in the future.


Uses:
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- axios
- bchaddrjs-slp (the one modified to work with ZCL/ZSLP, found [here](https://github.com/ZSLP/bchaddrjs))
